    "Our work with PHD won B&T's 2019 award for Best Media Campaign for Children's Panadol, and our work with OMD won B&T's 2019 award for Data Driven Marketing for McDonald's Monopoly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The role\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Senior Data Scientist in the marketing science team, you will be responsible for helping some of Omnicom's leading clients make informed data driven marketing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will analyse large amounts of data to determine how customers interact with our clients' advertising across different channels and devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your focus will be to develop custom attribution and predictive models for both online and offline media. Using these models, you will deliver actionable insights that will drive value to our clients and improve their ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "This role will allow you refine your work across a number of clients internally and externally. You will be responsible for evangelising the product across the agencies within Omnicom and really own the process that you will be responsible for creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your role will be to apply your broad skillset across data and analytics to understand business problems, create insights and envisage practical solutions in areas such as media measurement and customer insights\n",
    "* Build bespoke digital attribution models and improve our digital attribution product offering\n",
    "* Provide business solutions and optimisation through various statistical and quantitative methods.\n",
    "* Provide statistical models to support predictive analytics and deliver non-technical presentations to all levels of the business as well as technical documentation to the wider team.\n",
    "* Derive insights from data and communicate those insights to a non-technical audience through presentations and documentation\n",
    "* Build Annalect's experimentation/predictive modelling ecosystem\n",
    "* Build scalable backend solutions for automation of data processing\n",
    "* Analyse and mash-up massive amounts of data to mine useful business insights\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What you'll need\n",
    "\n",
    "* A strong background in data science, analytics, or data engineering\n",
    "* Proficiency and experience in statistical modelling and machine learning techniques (feature engineering, regression, classification, segmentation, cross validation, bootstrapping, Bayesian techniques etc.)\n",
    "* A high level of proficiency with at least one programming languages used in data science (R/Python/SAS/Scala/MATLAB).\n",
    "* Excellent communication skills - being able to both interpret and convey information in a clear, concise way with people from technical and non-technical background and use data to tell a story\n",
    "* Strong understanding of media, and media data\n",
    "* Ability to work in a fast-paced growth environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "Annalect is a part of Omnicom Media Group, an American based media company that services clients across several domains and; their primary purpose is to use advanced analytical techniques to enhance marketing decisions and strategies of said clients. Given that Omnicom deals with clients across a diverse range of domains, Annalect uses data and analytics to optimise marketing efforts for companies across healthcare and business (primarily). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a senior data scientist at Annalect, my primary purpose will be to analyse offline and online customer activity using customer datasets provided by clients. The analysis will utilise machine learning models (such as classification supervised machine learning techniques) to gain an insight into the effectiveness of current marketing strategies by examing the way in which customers interact with advertising. On gaining an insight into such interactions, Annalect may be able to predict whether or not a new customer is likely to make purchases online. Based on the results of the analysis we can make recommendations to clients on how they can maximise return on investment of marketing strategies. Hence, Annalect relies on analytics to not only gain insights but also make predictions. \n",

    "The purpose of this analysis is to create a model that is capable (with a certain degree of accuracy) of predicting whether or not a customer will contribute to the sales revenue of an online retailer. To be able to do so, we shall train and test Classifiers on an existing customer dataset that has been sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Web Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 12,330 online customers of an undisclosed online retailer and, comprises of 10 numerical features and 8 categorical features. The description of each feature can be accessed via the web link provided above. Given that the role requires the applicant to analyse customer interactions with online retailers, the dataset was deemed appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature termed 'Revenue' takes up the value, 'TRUE' for those customers that had made purchases online and 'FALSE' for those customers that had not. The dataset consists of 10,422 customers where 'Revenue' = 'FALSE' and 1908 customers where 'Revenue' = 'TRUE'. On being able to predict the 'Revenue' identification of new customers, we may be able to gain an insight into the effectiveness of targetted-marketing strategies while also gaining an insight into how the strategies can be optimised. For instance, a greater portion of marketing efforts can be focused on new customers who are predicted to make purchases online. Alternatively, a greater portion of marketing efforts can also be focused on those customers that are predicted to not make purchases online, thus enabling the client to capture a larger market share ('long tail theory')."

    "For the purpose of creating a model that is capable of classifying customers into those that contribute to online sales and those that do not, we use a supervised machine learning technique (i.e., Classification). The variable we are trying to predict is the 'Revenue' variable. Hence, we have a binary classification problem. Furthermore, given that we have 10,422 customers where 'Revenue' = 'FALSE' and 1908 customers where 'Revenue' = 'TRUE', we have a class imbalance problem. However, we assume that the dataset is a statistically accurate representation of customer behaviour online. Hence, we do not need to carry out stratified sampling to balance out the class labels in 'Revenue'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two classification techniques we will be utilising, is the K-Nearest Neighbour[s] classifier and the Gaussian-Naive Bayes Classifer. For both classifiers, we shall train and test the model on the same dataset using the K-Fold Cross Validation method. We will then utilise Pipelines to construct several models at once (based on several hyperparameter values and feature selection methods). From all the models that are created, we shall pick the one with the highest performance metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset does not consist of any missing values and is clean for the most part. Nonetheless, we make several adjustments to the dataset in order to prepare it for the pipeline we wish to create. The next section goes over the transformation and preparation of the dataset. The modelling phase is commenced after."

The random forest classifier has a higher f1-score and roc-auc score than the KNN model; a result that is of greater significance to us given than we have a class imbalance problem. It should also be noted that classification techniques had been utilised to predict whether or not new customers are going to make purchases online, based on the data of previous customers. If the purpose of the analysis is to gain insights into the online behaviour of consumers, we recommend using clustering machine learning algorithms."
